                    is a subset

            <p>While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even fully-abled
                people are “temporarily disabled”.
                For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily prevent you from being able to use a mouse.</p>
    
            <p>Robin Christopherson <a href=#footnote><sup>1</sup></a> once spoke about how people that are driving but use
                hands-free sets or have their
                phone connected to the car radio are temporarily disabled, as they use the phone differently to how they
                normally would. Of course, no one should
                browse websites while they are driving but it is important to understand different situations like that,
                where the user may not have special
                software installed that a disabled user might.</p>
